# StockSentiment
the project entails analysing the sentiment of news headlines about certain companies in order to produce a prediction on whether to buy/sell. The user will have choice of the companies, and results will be forwarded to emails every morning. This is a portfolio project and so will only have one user (me). The final project will hopefully display results through a react front end.
